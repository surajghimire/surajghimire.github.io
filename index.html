                                I had the privilege of working closely with Suraj Ghimire during a challenging period at our company when a key team member departed, leaving a critical gap in our data and reporting tasks.
                                Suraj stepped up and demonstrated his dedication and skills in maintaining the momentum of these vital responsibilities.
                                Suraj's ability to transition into this crucial role and take ownership of the data and reporting tasks was impressive. 
                                His determination to ensure a continuation of operations during this transition period was commendable. Suraj not only upheld the quality and consistency of our data and reporting but also made significant improvements to our processes, which will undoubtedly benefit the team in the long run.
                            <p> 
                                What struck me the most about Suraj was his positive attitude and resilience. Even in the face of knowing that he would eventually leave the company, he never wavered in his commitment to the team and the job at hand. His dedication, professionalism, and strong work ethic were evident in everything he did.
                            </p>

                            <p> I have no doubt that Suraj will excel in his future endeavors, and any team or organization would be fortunate to have him on board. He is not only a skilled data and reporting professional but also a team player who goes above and beyond to ensure the success of his colleagues and the company's goals.

                                <p>  I am pleased to extend my recommendation to Suraj Ghimire for any role related to data analysis, business strategies, quality frameworks, project management and any other related position at any organization.

                                In my capacity as Project and Quality Manager at WU, I have had the privilege to supervise indirectly and collaborate with Suraj for a span of more than 1 year. Throughout this period, he has consistently demonstrated top-tier analytical abilities combined with an unmatched work ethic.
                            </p>
                                <p>  Suraj's prowess in data analytics has been instrumental in several of our most successful projects. He has an innate ability to sieve through enormous sets of data, extract meaningful insights, and then translate these insights into actionable strategies. One notable instance was his pivotal role in the revamping of our digital operations platforms based on the data-driven insights he gathered, resulting in a significant increase in customer engagement.
                                </p>
                                Additionally, Suraj's exceptional skills in tools such as Power BI, Python, SQL, and R, combined with his adaptability to evolving technologies, place him at the forefront of the field. His ability to present complex data in a comprehensible manner has frequently bridged the gap between our tech team and non-tech stakeholders.
                                
                                <p>  Beyond his technical skills, what truly sets Suraj apart is his interpersonal communication and leadership qualities. He naturally assumes mentoring roles, guiding junior staff members with patience and expertise. His collaborative nature ensures that he integrates seamlessly into multidisciplinary teams, amplifying the team’s overall efficiency.

I firmly believe that he would not only meet but greatly exceed your expectations, bringing tangible value to your team.
