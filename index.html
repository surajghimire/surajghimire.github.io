            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> I am a data enthusiast and experienced data analyst with over three years of experience in the field.
                 My passion is to connect data and technologies with business and society, and I am committed to achieving long-term success with a persevering attitude.
                I have extensive experience in communication, project management, and stakeholder reporting, with a focus on team building and teamwork. 

                I am proficient in Python, Power BI, and SQL, and have applied machine learning algorithms in various projects. 
                I have experience leading project activities in agile methodologies and have led disaster relief and rehabilitation projects in the non-profit sector. 
                
                As a graduate student, I led a group of 200 students in the National Service Scheme and successfully organized blood donation camps, workshops on HIV-AIDS awareness, and women empowerment campaigns. 
                
                I completed a Master of Science in Data Science from Grenoble INP Ensimag in 2021 and enjoy writing blogs, learning about entrepreneurship, and creating digital content in my free time.</p>
